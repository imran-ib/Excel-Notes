# Microsoft Word Basic 

- If You hit `Enter` it will give you hard return meaning more space between line and start a new paragraph but sometimes you may want to return in same paragraph. You can do this by `shift + Enter` 
- You can Enable marks to see where paragraph is used or soft return or tab key etc.  `Home -> Paragraph - >show/hide marks`
- `shift + tab` to get out of sub list to main list item 
- `Home -> Styles` we can apply formatting to our document with consistency.
- You can also create custom styles for selected and styled text  in `home -> styles`  and later if want to change some styles you can also modify it by right clicking in custom style
- `home -> font -> clear formatting ` to clear the formatting of selected text 

# Margins

`Layout -> Page Setup -> margin`  or we can set margin by enabling ruler. `view ->show -> ruler` 

# Columns

`Layout -> Page Setup -> columns`

# Page Breaks

Place your cursor where you want to break the page 

`Layout -> Page Setup ->  Breaks -> Page`

**shortcut key    `ctr+Enter`**

if we apply the columns in our word document it will apply to entire document. We can prevent this default behavior by  using section break

`Layout -> Page Setup ->  Breaks -> Page`

# Change Orientation 

`Layout -> Page Setup -> Orientation`

we can use same technique (section break ) to view pages in deferent orientations  

# Headers and Footers

Double click on the top or bottom of the page and you will have `Header & Footer tools`

*If you bring your cursor to top of the page (top edge line) and double click header and footer will be hidden so that you can focus on the content instead of header footer* 

In ruler you can set tab stops (how much cursor should move when press tab ) default is center.

We can set tab stops by clicking on the point we want to use tab stop and click and drag out of ruler to remove it.
