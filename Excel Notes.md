# Excel Notes

### Some use full shortcuts 

- We can use the key `f12` to save as the file

- To move around in deferent sheets `ctr +pgUp / ctr + pgDn`

- To Apply `Format Painter` in multiple cells we can double click in formatted cell and click on the cell we want to format. Click `Esc` to cancel format 

- `ctr + R` to fill Right and `ctr + D` to fill Down 

- We can use text in cell `strikethrough scubscript superscript` in format cell options.

- When we write data in cell and change it later the format of cell remain same. You have to change format manually.

  - For Example you Enter string `abc` in a cell and later you change it to `123` the format of cell do not change you have to change it to `number`

- We can save lot of time by using excel's autofill option to populate data by clinking the bottom right corner of cell and dragging it to any direction. Excel will populate any list of data (months , days , years , numbers) 

  - We can also add **custom list** to excel 

     **Adding Custom List For AutoFill**

  `file -> Options -> Advance -> Edit Custom List`

  Here We Can either add or import list (add manually here or write in current sheet and import list from there)

- Apply on Cell format (styles) to All The cell (row or column)

  -	`Home -> Clipboard -> FormatPainter`

  ### Merge and Center 

  - Select the text and all empty cells you want to merge in and 
  - `Home -> Alignment -> Merge & Center` it will merge the text and center it 

## Doing Simple Math

We Are Familiar with old fashion sum formula to we skip it.

But One Important thing 

**We can find details about selected values cell or column by selecting them and look left bottom of sheet , there we can find values (sum , avg , min , max etc) of selected cells/columns or right click and get any value you want **

<u>We Can user `ctr + r` to fill the right column with same formula </u>

<u>We Can user `ctr + d` to fill the down column with same formula </u>

## Evaluate Formula 

As we know that order of execution of formula in excel just works as normal math order which is `BODMAS`

As we write complex formulas it is harder to think which part is executed first.

We can Evaluate the formula and debug it 

`Formula -> Formula Auditing -> Evaluate Formula`

# Sorting

apart from Normal Filter we can use some advance filters in `Numbrs Filters`

Here we can Also use **Custom Filters**
